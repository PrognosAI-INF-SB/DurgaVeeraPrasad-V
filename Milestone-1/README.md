Milestone 1: Data Preparation & Feature Engineering

Project Name: PrognosAI: AI-Driven Predictive Maintenance System Using Time-Series Sensor Data
Dataset: NASA Turbofan Jet Engine Data Set
Prepared by: Durga Veera Prasad V

Objective:  
Prepare the NASA CMAPSS dataset for training a predictive maintenance model by cleaning data, calculating RUL, normalizing features, and generating sequences for model input.

---

Modules Used and Their Purpose:
pandas: Load and manipulate tabular datasets (`train`, `test`, `RUL` files).  
numpy: Numerical operations, array handling, and RUL calculations.  
sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler: Normalize sensor and operational features between 0 and 1.  
os: Handle file paths and check for dataset files.  

(TensorFlow/Keras is not used in Milestone 1; it will be used in Milestone 2 for modeling.)

Steps Implemented:

1. Data Loading
   - Loaded training, test, and RUL files for FD001â€“FD004 datasets.
   - Assigned column names and set RUL indices for easy lookup.


2. RUL Calculation
   - Training data: `RUL = max_cycle - current_cycle`, capped at 125 for stability.
   - Test data: Adjusted RUL using `RUL_FD00X.txt` plus remaining cycles.

3. Data Normalization
   - Normalized sensor and operational settings using `MinMaxScaler`.
   - Applied same scaler to training and test datasets to maintain consistency.

4. Feature Engineering & Sequence Generation
   - Created rolling window sequences (`sequence_length = 50`) for each engine.
   - Generated RUL targets for sequences.
   - Prepared `X_train, y_train` and `X_test_dict, y_test_dict` arrays for modeling.

---

Deliverables:
- Preprocessed and normalized datasets.
- RUL targets for all engines.
- Rolling window sequences ready for LSTM input.

Evaluation:
- Checked dataset shapes, missing values, and sequence generation.
- Verified normalization consistency across datasets.
