    "Project Name: PrognosAI: AI-Driven Predictive Maintenance System Using Time-Series Sensor Data",
    "Dataset: train_FD001 â€“ NASA Turbofan Jet Engine Data Set",
    "Prepared by: Durga Veera Prasad V",
    "Date: 30th September 2025",
    "",
    "1. Objective:",
    "- Load, preprocess, and prepare the CMAPSS dataset for model training.",
    "- Create rolling window sequences.",
    "- Compute RUL targets.",
    "- Save processed data for model training.",
    "",
    "2. Dataset Description:",
    "- Source: train_FD001.txt (converted to CSV: train_FD001.csv)",
    "- Columns: unit_nr, time_in_cycles, op_settings 1-3, sensors s1-s21, RUL",
    "- Selected 10 sensors + 3 operational settings for modeling.",
    "",
    "3. Methodology:",
    "Step 1: Load Data - Read CSV using pandas.",
    "Step 2: Compute RUL - RUL = max(cycle) - current cycle per engine.",
    "Step 3: Feature Selection & Normalization - Select features, fill missing values, standardize.",
    "Step 4: Generate Rolling Window Sequences - Window length 30, sequence labeled with last cycle RUL.",
    "Step 5: Data Verification - Check missing values, shapes, sample RULs.",
    "Step 6: Save Processed Data - Save X and y as .npz for model training.",
    "",
    "4. Results:",
    "- Number of sequences: 17,731",
    "- Sequence length: 30 cycles",
    "- Number of features per sequence: 13",
    "- Missing values in features used: 0",
    "- Sample RUL values: [162, 161, 160, 159, 158, 157, 156, 155, 154, 153]",
    "",
    "5. Conclusion:",
    "- Data preparation pipeline successfully completed.",
    "- X (rolling windows) and y (RUL labels) ready for model training.",
    "- Data integrity verified; pipeline is reproducible and robust.",
